This is a simple python script to extract Spells from the Mage the Awakening 2e book. 
A copy of the book is required for this to work. Place the book in a 'pdf' folder at the project's root and name it 'mage.pdf'. 

Eventually, I'll add code to automatically package the extracted CSVs into a module, but for now it's best to import them manually via the data toolbox Foundry module.
